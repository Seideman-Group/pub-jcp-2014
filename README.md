========

This repository contains data and figures used in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4870335">"Theory of Ultrafast Photoinduced Electron Transfer from a Bulk Semiconductor to a Quantum Dot"</a> as well as the source code used to generate the data and figures.

Pre-compiled data and figures are in the directory

    pre-compiled/

and the source code and Makefile are in the directory

    you-compile/

## Software requirements

To compile the dynamics code and create the data, you need:

0. A compatible OS.  This code has been tested on Arch Linux 3.13.6-1, CentOS 6.4 and Mac OS X 10.9.2.
1. A C++ compiler, <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-education-offerings">Intel</a> or <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> recommended.  The Makefile for the code is configured to work with `icpc` by default, but is configurable to use other compilers.
2. An implementation of the <a href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/">LAPACK</a> linear algebra library, either Intel <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl">MKL</a> (included with Intel compiler suites) or another distribution
3. The <a href="http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/download/download.html">SUNDIALS</a> differential ordinary equation solver package
4. (For figures) <a href="http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/">gnuplot</a> (version 4.6.0+ recommended)
5. (For thermally-averaged data) <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a>

## Instructions

0.  Install the requirements as listed above.
1.  If using a compiler other than icpc, edit `you-compile/code/Makefile` accordingly.
2.  To make everything, type `make` at the command line.

    To make just the code, type `make code`.

    To make just the data, type `make data`.

    To make just the plots, type `make plots`.

Note: figures which do not use data are not generated by this repository.

## Downloading without git

0.  Download the tarball `pre-compiled.tar.gz`
