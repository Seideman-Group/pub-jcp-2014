========

This repository contains data and figures used in "Theory of Ultrafast Photoinduced Electron Transfer from a Bulk Semiconductor to a Quantum Dot" as well as the source code used to generate the data and figures.

Pre-compiled data and figures are in the directory

> pre-compiled/

and the source code and Makefile are in the directory

> you-compile/

## Software requirements

To compile the dynamics code, you need:

1) Either the Intel compiler suite or g++ along with the LAPACK linear algebra library
2) SUNDIALS

## Instructions

Note: figures which do not use data are not generated by this repository.
